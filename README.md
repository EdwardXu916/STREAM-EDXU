## Who am I?

Hi, everyone. I am Edward, a master student in Technical University of Denmark.

I am constructing the STREAM model using Python.

The model can be downloaded in this website. [STREAM](http://streammodel.org)

## Introduction to STREAM Model

Modeling regional energy system on basis of STREAM from DTU Management using Python

The STREAM model was originally built to provide fast and complete analysis of energy flow. It is a relatively simple tool. It guarantees the possibility to make analysis and changes in a quick way, also during meetings and workshops, since the time for running is reduced; compared to the calculation hours that complex and detailed models need. STREAM model is not an optimization tool, so it cannot give the optimal and low cost solutions for the future energy market, but it allows simulating different scenarios and comparing different solutions for the system.

One of the main characteristics of STREAM is the ability of modelling the whole energy system and showing the complete energy flow. Thus, it is possible to look at all sectors of a country (or region) using different combinations of fuels and conversion technologies, and considering the electricity, heat and transport systems at the same time.

The model is divided in two Excel spreadsheets, as illustrated in Figure 1, which are further described in the following sections:
1. The Energy Flow Model: demand & supply
2. The Duration Curve Model: system balancing
